# Documentation in English

This folder contains key documentation translated into English. Migrate main documents here and keep
the structure aligned with the main docs folder.

## Migration Example

- Copy and translate `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` → `docs/en/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`
- Copy and translate `docs/CONTRIBUTING_DOCS.md` → `docs/en/CONTRIBUTING_DOCS.md`

## Recommendations

- Keep TOCs updated.
- Sync important changes between languages.
- Use badges and roles as in the main folder.
