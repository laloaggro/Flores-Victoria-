# ADR-001: Port Manager Implementation

**Status:** üü¢ Accepted **Date:** 2025-10-20 **Deciders:** @team

## Context and Problem Statement

Need a centralized way to manage ports across dev/prod/test environments to avoid conflicts.

## Decision Drivers

- Prevent EADDRINUSE errors
- Easy port discovery
- Support multiple environments
- CLI-friendly

## Considered Options

1. Manual port assignment in .env files
2. Centralized Port Manager with JSON config
3. Docker port mapping only
